# Complex-Numbers
A GUI forms application using operator overloading to create a complex number calculator.

A complex number is a number in the form (a + bi) like (4 + 9i) or (-4 - 9i). In this case, i is the imaginary number which is the square root of -1.

The ComplexNumber class models the complex number above, for example, and overloads the following operators: unary (+ and -), binary (+, x, /, -), and relational (== and !=). Additionally, the required Equals, GetHashCode, and ToString methods from Object get overridden.

This app allows for the user to perform all operations on the complex numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), accounts for invalid data entered by the user on the form, and can also verify if the two operands share equality.

Proof of test cases for the different operations can be found in the corresponding Word document with screenshots showing the code when running.

This app was developed with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 Community (various versions).

Thanks for looking!
